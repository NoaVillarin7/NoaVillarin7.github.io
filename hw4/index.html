<p class="text">If you've ever been to a bar, or shopped at a convenience store, chances are you've had corn nuts. These are not those corn nuts. These are different, from start to finish. Soup to nuts, if you will. Trader Joe's GIANT Peruvian Inca Corn are a decidedly South American take on the corn nut, with roots dating back to the Incas themselves. Way back in the days of the Incan empire (approx. mid-15th-mid-16th centuries), toasted corn was a common snack. The Incas experimented widely with corn. They hybridized and cross-bred varieties to create bigger, more flavorful kernels. The white Peruvian corn used in our GIANT Peruvian Inca Corn is known as Choclo or Cuzco, and is a direct descendent of the varieties created and cultivated by the Incas. It's grown in Peru's Sacred Valley of the Incas, and it really is GIANT! In fact, the kernels are five times the size of the average North American corn kernels. When toasted, the corn takes on a nutty flavor, and the size of the kernels translates to GIANT crunch! We've added a little salt to round out the flavor. You don't need to be in a bar to enjoy them, but they do pair nicely with a cold beer. </p>
